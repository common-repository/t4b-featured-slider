"T4B Featured Slider" allows you to show featured posts on your blog using a smooth jQuery slider.


== Description == 
"T4B Featured Slider" is a simple and easy WordPress plugin to show featured posts on your blog using a smooth jQuery slider.


== Notice ==
We will not upgrade this plugin any more! The coding structure of this plugin is not perfect for responsive design. Users who want to show their slider in responsive view, we recommend our new slider plugin, [**Elegant Responsive Content Slider**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elegant-responsive-content-slider/). It is also made by bxSlider, which is responsive and has two different mode, **Fullscree Mode** and **Boxed View Mode** same as this plugin.
